# chemsec

LaTeX style for automated creation of numeric chemical
labels for scientific documents.

For documentation run

    latex chemsec.dtx

To generate style file run

    latex chemsec.ins

The style file in this directory should always be identical
to the file generated by `latex chemsec.ins`

# Examples

Several examples accompany the CTAN package in the `chemsec`
directory.  You can compile these by processing the files twice
using a latex program.

    <latex command> example1
    <latex command> example1

If you obtain the package from the GitHub repository you can run 
the examples by changing to the `test` subdirectory and using the
supplied makefile. For example to process the `example1.tex` file
use:

    make clean example1

or
    make LATEX=latex clean example1

if you want to use a latex program other than `pdflatex`.

## Note

* The examples use the chemsec.sty file in the base
directory, this is not updated by the make program.

* The make program copies the example latex files and the
style file into the test directory. Dependency tracking
should keep these up to date.

* The clean target should remove everything but the
makefile from the test directory.
